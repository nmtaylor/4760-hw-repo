Homework repository for Network Security/CodePath Week 9

I deployed the default MHN honeypot using the Google Cloud Platform. The only issue I encountered was that on my initial attempt at the assignment, running nmap from Powershell didn't register any attacks on the honeypot. I tried making a second, which also didn't work, then deleted both and made another new one, which also didn't work. I ended up scrapping everything I had and restarting from step 1, and it worked the second time. The number keeps going up, but at the time of writing my honeypot currently has 1030 attacks after running for less than 5 minutes. Not sure how many malware samples it collected, but I'm sure it's also an alarming number.
